# ExpenseTracker

## xPense System

Keeping track of your expenses can be tiring and more often than not, people spend more than they can afford to. We are developing an expense tracker system to help solve this problem. Individuals can set targets for reaching a certain amount of income and track their expenditures by creating an expenditure. If you surpass your daily limit set, the system will alert you. If the cost of the day is lower, the amount left would be added to your savings. The regular expenditure monitoring system will produce a report to display the income - expense at the end of the month. It will allow you to add the amount of savings you saved for special occasions or events. Custom reports can be generated per user based on their spending habits to check which expenses can be cut down to help cultivate saving.
